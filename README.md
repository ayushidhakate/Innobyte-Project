# Innobyte-Project
Redesign of the Kingsukh Guest House website as part of my internship at Innobyte! The new website features a fresh and modern look, enhanced with a carefully selected color palette that reflects the welcoming and cozy atmosphere of Kingsukh Guest House.

## Key Highlights:

### Technology Stack: 
Utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a dynamic and engaging user experience.

### Bootstrap 5.0.2: 
Integrated Bootstrap 5.0.2 to ensure a responsive design, providing seamless navigation across all devices.

### User-Friendly Interface: 
Focused on creating a user-friendly interface to enhance visitor engagement and ease of use.

### Responsive Design: 
Ensured the website is fully responsive, offering an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

I'm thrilled to contribute to enhancing the online presence of Kingsukh Guest House and look forward to more opportunities to apply my skills in web development. Visit the new website and experience the refreshed look!
